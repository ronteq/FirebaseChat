# Firebase Chat

This is a chat application build with Swift 3 and Firebase. With this app you can send messages, upload pictures and videos. It also has pagination to look for older messages.

This is just a demo app so I choose MVC as my architecture with a Service layer to make the Firebase stuff.

## Getting Started

To make sure Firebase is in your project, just run:

```
pod install
```
